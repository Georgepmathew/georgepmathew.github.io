# Projects

Here are selected projects that demonstrate my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

## Project Title: [e.g., Finite Element Analysis of a Bridge Girder]

*   **Course/Context:** [e.g., Final Year Project, B.Sc. Civil Engineering]
*   **Date:** [e.g., May 2021]

### The Challenge
[Clearly state the problem in 1-2 sentences. e.g., "The goal was to analyze the stress and deformation characteristics of a steel I-beam under various load conditions to ensure it met safety standards according to Eurocode 3."]

### My Actions & The Tools Used
[Describe your specific actions in bullet points. Focus on what *you* did. Mention software and methods.]
*   Modeled the 3D geometry of the beam using AutoCAD.
*   Performed a static structural analysis using ANSYS software to simulate dead loads and live loads.
*   Systematically documented material properties (Steel S355) and boundary conditions.
*   Interpreted the simulation results to identify points of maximum stress and deflection.

### The Outcome & Key Learnings
[State the result and what you learned. Quantify if possible.]
*   **Outcome:** The analysis confirmed that the proposed beam design had a safety factor of 1.8, exceeding the required 1.5. A report was generated recommending the design for implementation.
*   **Learnings:** This project provided me with hands-on experience in Finite Element Method (FEM) software and reinforced my understanding of the relationship between theoretical mechanics and real-world structural behavior.
