    Hello! My name is George P. Mathew. I am a Civil Engineer with a B.E. from Mar Ephraem College of Engineering and Technology, Anna University. My passion for building and problem-solving led me to explore various fields, and I am excited to announce that I will be pursuing my Master's degree in Materials Engineering at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen for the winter intake of 2025.

<p>
    I'm focused on applying my knowledge to real-world projects and am interested in continuing to learn and develop in the field of engineering. This portfolio is a showcase of my projects and skills, which I've built through my academic and professional experiences.
