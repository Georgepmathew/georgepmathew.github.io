# About Me

I am a results-oriented engineer transitioning from a broad foundation in Civil Engineering to a focused specialization in Materials Engineering. My goal is to apply principles of material science to solve complex challenges in high-performance industrial applications. I am currently beginning my Master's program at the prestigious RWTH Aachen University to deepen my expertise.

### My Foundation in Civil Engineering

*   **Degree:** Bachelor of Science, Civil Engineering (2021)
*   **Experience:** Two years of professional experience at [Previous Company Name], where I worked on [Describe 1-2 key responsibilities or projects, e.g., structural analysis for infrastructure projects, quality control of construction materials].
*   **Key Skills Gained:** Project management, structural analysis, understanding of material tolerances and standards (e.g., DIN, Eurocodes), and a systematic approach to problem-solving.

### The Pivot to Materials Engineering: A Strategic Specialization

My work in civil engineering consistently brought me to the intersection of design and material limitations. I recognized that the next frontier of innovation lies not just in how we design structures, but in the fundamental materials we use to build them. This realization drove my decision to pursue a Master's in Materials Engineering. My focus is on [mention a specific area, e.g., advanced polymers, metal alloys, or composite materials] to develop solutions that are lighter, stronger, and more sustainable.

### My Goals at RWTH Aachen and Beyond

At RWTH, I intend to focus my studies and research on [mention specific RWTH institutes or research areas if you know them, e.g., the Institute of Metal Research (IMM)]. My objective is to contribute to projects that have direct industry applications, particularly in the German automotive or aerospace sectors. I am eager to connect with industry leaders and researchers to find opportunities where I can apply my unique blend of structural and material science knowledge.
